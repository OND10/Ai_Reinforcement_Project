How to create a Streamlit dashboard
Training a logistic regression model for machine learning
Visualizing data using Plotly
Displaying predictions based on user input
Creating an AI full-stack app using Python

In this video tutorial, we train a logistic regression model using machine learning in Python. We will be using a dataset to predict whether a cell cluster is 
benign or malignant. Once our model is ready, we will integrate it into a Streamlit application that runs in the web browser. 
You'll see how easy it is to create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Python! Next, we will visualize our data using Plotly to create informative and interactive 
charts.These visualizations will help users understand the predictions made by our machine-learning model. We'll then display the predictions based on the user's input, 
making our dashboard not only visually appealing but also highly functional.Throughout the tutorial, we'll explore various techniques and best practices used by experts 
like Nicholas Renotte and Patrick Loeber. This Streamlit tutorial is an excellent resource for data science dashboard projects 
and a great way to learn how to create a machine learning app.By the end of this course, you will have created an AI full-stack app using Python, 
Streamlit, and machine learning. You'll be ready to tackle your own machine-learning projects and create amazing data science dashboards!
